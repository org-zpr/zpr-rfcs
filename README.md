# ZPR RFCs
This repository contains the publicly-available RFCs for the Zero-trust Packet Routing project.  Feedback is welcome and encouraged!

While not all of our RFCs and documentation are currently publicly available, more will be published in the future, so keep an eye on this space!

## Where to Start?
If you are new to ZPR, you should take a look at [RFC 12](https://github.com/org-zpr/zpr-rfcs/blob/main/pdf/12-ZPR-Overview.pdf), which is an overview of ZPR, the problems it aims to solve, and the approach taken to solving them.

If you find any of the terminology unclear or confusing, take a look at [RFC 4](https://github.com/org-zpr/zpr-rfcs/blob/main/pdf/4-Terminology.pdf), which is a glossary of terms used when discussing ZPR.

## What Else?
If you are interested in learning more about ZPR beyond what's in the overview, you can dig deeper into any of the following topics:
* [RFC 15](https://github.com/org-zpr/zpr-rfcs/blob/main/pdf/15-ZPL-Overview.pdf) - Overview of the ZPL Policy Language
* [RFC 16](https://github.com/org-zpr/zpr-rfcs/blob/main/pdf/16-Identity.pdf) - ZPR's Concept of Identity
